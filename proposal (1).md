# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RunRun

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A girl has to fight off monsters and other creatures to make it to safety. 

## In a paragragh or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using pygame to make my project. It will consist of six lives, and I would like to mkae it give options for what character you can choose. The character will be going through the motions of a torn down city and have to make it out to her destintation safely. I also plan on making my own characters, monsters, music, etc. I would like to make it an efficent game that I could see myself playing in the future. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on combining it. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NONE

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish giving my character lives, and the character died when the monster hits them. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would say is having my design most of the visuals myself.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ideal is hvaing my own music and having a choice of different characters. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to figure out pygame, which I can do with youtube since there are a ton of resources. I want to get teh basic code first. Then I will focus on the visuals last because I feel that making it look pretty isnt really the most important thing. That is just a personal thing. I will probably ask family for help as well if I get stuck but for now doing basic research on how to start from complete scratch. How to propely download pygame on my laptop and things of that nature.
